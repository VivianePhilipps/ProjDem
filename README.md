This repository includes the R package MCSPCD forked from Florian Guillet and R codes using that package.

data\_description.R describes the input data of the MCSPCD::estimHI\_3FDR function.

example\_estimHI\_3FDR.R gives a call to the MCSPCD::estimHI\_3FDR function to estimate health indicators and their confidence intervals.
